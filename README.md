> A web application to help refugees reunite with their loved ones.



## Back Story
Light is a web application for refugees who have been separated from their families and friends to be reunited with them once again. Aid workers would be able to use this application to store a refugees information once they arrive at an aid station. Users will be able to locate a refugee by clicking on their location on the refugeeâ€™s list and it then marks it on a map to show visually where they are.

## Target Audience
- Refugees arriving at aid stations
- Aid stations will be able to input a refugees information upon arrival
- Family/friends of the refugee
